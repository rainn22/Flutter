Q1 - In what scenarios might one approach be more advantageous than another?
(in terms of readability, maintainability, performance, etc.)?

Integrating the Loop Directly into the List
- Readability: Good for short and simple but hard when the logic is complex
- Performance: Faster
- Maintainability: Hard for change or reuse

Using the map() Method
- Readability: More readable than direct loop if logic is complex
- Performance: slight performance impact due to the function call and list transformation
- Maintainability: Better for dynamic lists, more reusable

Using a Dedicated Function
- Readability: Easy to understand
- Performance: requires an extra function call for each widget creation
- Maintainability: more maintainable as it separates the widget creation logic from the main UI layout
